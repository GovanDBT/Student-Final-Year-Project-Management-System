              This document is a brief guide to the ISS402 and CSI408 final year
              projects. It has been produced to answer some of the questions
              which students ask and to provide information about certain
              aspects of the project process such as project diaries, reports
              and assessment. It is not intended to be definitive. Projects by
              their very nature are individual and it is not possible to set
              down rules which will apply to and govern all aspects of them in
              all cases. What is presented here is a mixture of things which are
              common to all projects for example project diaries and guidelines
              which attempt to ensure that the difference between projects is
              kept to a minimum. The material covered includes the
              responsibilities of the student and of the supervisor, the various
              milestones along the way and the assessment process. If there are
              any points about which you are unsure, please discuss them with
              your project supervisor in the first case and with the Project
              Coordinator if that doesn't resolve your problems.

              Conducting Project work enables students to gain experience in a
              number of areas, which are relevant to a professional career. From
              an educational point of view, it enables you to:

            <p>
              You will spend a lot of time on your project so it is important
              that you choose a subject area that interests you. You are
              expected to manage your time and plan your work to keep to the
              milestones (or Deadlines) specified in section 3. Your supervisor
              will assist and monitor your progress but it is your
              responsibility to carry out the work and meet the deadlines.

                NOTE: it is the student's responsibility to seek supervision -
                it is not a supervisor's responsibility to seek out absent

                Students must submit a copy of their weekly diary sheet (see
                Appendix A) to their supervisor at each meeting, and both
                student and supervisor sign the diary sheet. The diary should
                indicate:

                the weekly meeting of the student with the supervisor. In
                addition it will be a valuable aid when the time comes for
                writing the project reports. One important use for the diary

                number of marks are therefore dedicated to assessing how well
                you develop and demonstrate your project management skills
                throughout the duration of the project.
              </li>

                A project management mark is assessed at various points in the
                project - at each progress report assessment and at final report
                assessment -see section 9 for details-. This mark focuses on
                your performance to date in areas such as initiative,
                commitment, planning and scheduling. Your supervisor will assess
                you based on your weekly meetings and your diary sheets.
              </li>
              <li>
                The project management deliverables -which includes diary
                sheets- should be submitted to the project supervisor on or
                before the submission of the progress report or the final
                project report.
              </li>
              <li>
                The student must interact regularly with the supervisor. During
                these interactions, there must have been some significant pieces
                of work assigned to the student, which the student has to
                carry-out and submit to the supervisor. In a semester the
                supervisor must record the best five of such progress meetings.
                Supervisors are to make use of a form similar to the one in
                table 1.

                The presentation should be articulate, visual, professional and
                organized. Presentation is about the overall project, focusing
                on what problem is addressed, models of the problem & solution,
                implementation. Important issues include what has been done,
                what has not been achieved and what has been learned.

                Project presentation will only be permitted after submission of
                the final report. Project presentation will be fifteen minutes
                followed by five minutes demonstration of your project
                implementation. This will be followed by comments, queries,
                questions from the audience and the examining panel.
